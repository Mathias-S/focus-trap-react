**Description**
Clear and concise description of the issue.

**Versions**
- Browser/OS verion(s) involved:
- focus-trap-react version used:

**Sandbox**
Minimal reproduction in something like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/):
- If you can repro it in [focus-trap](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap), __even better__ as that will exonerate `focus-trap-react` which tries to just be a wrapper for the real library.
- If you can't repro it there, that's helpful too since it points to `focus-trap-react` as the culprit.

**Screen Capture**
Recording or screenshot of what you're seeing -- if the repro isn't sufficient to explain it.
